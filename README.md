# Website
This is the code for the official club website, currently a work in progress.

## Note

Be sure to push to the origin/dev branch for now

## Plan

We are going to use Polymer, a web library developed by Google.
https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/

There will be some tutorials below.

### Features  

- List of projects we have made or are working on.
- Events that we will be hosting.
- Contact info for the club. This will allow people to request projects.
- About page.
- Showcase of Open Source projects we like.
- Internet Relay Chat (IRC) for easy communication
- Easter Egg switch. Have an "experimental" switch that has the website "break down" and just act kinda crazy.
  - Possibly a "terminal" to play with.
  - Konami Code some where.
  - Any other suggestions?

## Tutorials

Check out the Tutorial.md in the Intro to Web Design folder for a introduction to HTML, CSS, and Polymer.
