# Website

This is the code for the [official club website](https://ufosc.github.io/).

## Note

This really needs a full refresh, but it's not used enough to warrant a ton of time put into it. Current problems: Polymer 1 is outdated and slow, the site wasn't designed with best practices, needs to automatically sync with the calender/Facebook/GitHub.
