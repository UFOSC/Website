# Website
This is the code for the official club website, currently a work in progress. 

## Plan

We are going to use Polymer, a web library developed by Google. 
https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/

There will be some tutorials below. 

### Features  

- List of projects we have made or are working on.
- Events that we will be hosting. 
- Contact info for the club. This wll allow people to request projects.
- About page.
- Showcase of Open Source projects we like. 
- Internet Relay Chat (IRC) for easy comunication 
- Easter Egg switch. Have an "experimental" switch that has the website "break down" and just act kinda crazy.
  - Possibly a "terminal" to play with.
  - Konami Code some where.
  - Any other suggestions?
